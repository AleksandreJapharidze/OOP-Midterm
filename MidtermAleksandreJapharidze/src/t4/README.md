## Personal experience of the first midterm exam in OOP

1. #### Challenges faced:
The main challenge I have faced in during this midterm exam is understanding some tasks clearly, out of time pressure and my general awkwardness. For example, I couldn't understand what exact packages to create and not create or whatever in task 2. And I also didn't know what was this "md" file, but I eventually found out.

2. #### Usefulness of AI tools:
Yes, AI tools were helpful to me on this midterm. They helped me a lot in clarifying what several tasks were telling me to do, explaining them in a more easy-to-understand langauge for me than was written. I also didn't exactly know what JavaDocs or md files were, AI enlightened me in these too. AI tools also helped me a bit in task 3, giving me the idea of the new feature to add there. 

3. #### Uselessness of AI tools:
I tried to use AI's help in Task 2, but that task was contained a lot of complicated packages stuff and that's where AI isn't that useful. And explaining the goal was a headache of its own, haha.
